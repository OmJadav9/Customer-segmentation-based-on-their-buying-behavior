**Customer Segmentation Based on Buying Behavior**
**Overview**
This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms, to analyze and categorize customers based on their buying behavior. The dataset used for this project is sourced from an online retail database and includes information on customer transactions, product details, and countries.

**Introduction**
The primary goal of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns. This segmentation can provide valuable insights for marketing strategies, personalized customer experiences, and targeted campaigns. The project utilizes various techniques such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and two clustering algorithms: K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

**Data Preprocessing**
The initial steps involve loading the dataset, handling missing values, and creating a dictionary to track product sales in different countries. The data is then cleaned and transformed to prepare for further analysis.

**Top Selling Products**
Identifying the top-selling products in the United Kingdom is crucial for understanding market trends. A bar chart is generated to visualize the top products based on quantities sold.

**Total Sales in Each Country**
A pie chart is created to illustrate the distribution of total sales across different countries. This analysis provides an overview of the revenue contribution from each country.

**K-Means Clustering**
The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to group customers based on features like the number of purchases, total quantity bought, and other relevant metrics. The Elbow Method is utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters.

**Hierarchical Clustering**
Hierarchical clustering is employed to further explore customer segmentation. The dendrogram is plotted, and the AgglomerativeClustering algorithm is utilized to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior.

**Conclusion**
The results obtained from the clustering algorithms provide valuable insights into customer segmentation. This information can guide business strategies, targeted marketing efforts, and customer relationship management.
